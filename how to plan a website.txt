how to plan a website
ArtBusinessCraft

few basic things: simple

plans.  notepad?  like building something in your woodshop

planning gets easier and less necessary with experience

the process:
step 1: whats the #1 goal?  the one thing the site has to do well?
[NOT the five things, showcases, features, etc]
think about it
for example bradhussey.ca thinks he may redesign his own website with us on the youtube 
its got all kinds of content etc
but whats the goal for him?
*collect emails of subscribers*
because he has a really robust
marketing system that moves them from where they started to
where they need to be, so the magic can happen 24/7
[NOT goals: i want a beautiful website, i want this font]
[POSSIBLE goals: i want more foot traffic, phone calls, emails, purchases on site, course sales, leads] = actual meaningful goals, depends on the client.
everything is focused around THE GOAL
--YO BEFORE YOU GO!  don't you want to ? why don't you!

--watch out for lying answers, and ignorance
----ask more questions, why do you think that, why why keep driving down until its interesting and real.  THE ROOT.


step 2: idea vomit your content (edgy slogan!)
all your ideas for your website
write out everything that you & client want 
focused on the goal.  everything is in light of that goal.
get it out (NO EDITING) "idea vomits"

Unique Value Proposition

step 3: organize content into a sitemap
intially brainstorm a sitemap
