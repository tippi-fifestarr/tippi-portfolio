lightweight framework
its practiced everywhere
one scrum guide (read this!)
study guide link https://www.scrumguides.org/
discovered a glossary quizlet: https://quizlet.com/280838102/learn
after doing 8 cards, i got 7 right on the first guess (from multiple choice)

back to vid:
rename pomodoro to "sprint"
prioritize requirements into Product Backlog
define sprint time & do planning into a "sprint backlog"
start sprinting => potentially deployable product
small team ~6-7 people
goes to sprint review 
then give the first increment (and push any backlog into the next sprint)
before the next sprint, you'll be doing a retrospective:
what worked well?
what could be improved?
what will we commit to doing in the next one (actionable commitments)

did some trello work, sent screenshot to danjo
