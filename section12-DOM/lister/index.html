		<li>welcome, i am the human version of "tippi fifestarr: the introduction/bio bot."  How are you doing?  This is my first time writing this, so be generous with your tips and evaluation.  I was born in Chicago 2020, on my first day of work as a Lyft Driver.  I am a reflection of my goal for the user experience, namely:  "tips" and 5 stars.  Really really good name, right?  fun fact, I have said (at least once) that the tip is, in fact, the mythical 6th star.  Those ~200 rides in only 1 month, they taught me somethings. The CAR that I had to rent because my 95 Camry wasn't new enough taught me somethings.  Driving nights in the winter moments before the virus and covid-related emotions finally hit my city, that taught me somethings.  Many somethings, in fact.  Ask me about them if you are curious, but be warned that I may become very curious about you as a person rather than a tool.  Since I was renting the car from Lyft and Hrz at a not-cheap price, I shifted gears.  It turns out, I was always shifting gears; flash forward to 2021, since that first day as a Driver I've had new roles:[MOOC student, Driving Sensei, awesomeness advisor, Census Enumerator, confused coder, game developer, online course teacher (WC&MP)].  One thing I am certain, it is up to oneself to do the work of learning, using, and creating; we don't have to climb the mountain alone. I hope some of you reach back with care or at least memes.   TL;DR: coding is awesome, what is important to you, as a coder? Why did you join the group?</li>
